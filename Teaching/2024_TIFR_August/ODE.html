<b>Classes</b> will be held 9:00 AM to 10:20 AM on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from the 13th of August. One of these classes each week will be a quiz and left for clarification of doubts.  If you have questions, please ask your queries by Monday morning 9 AM. I am not very good with stand-up.
<br>
<hr>

<b>Grading Scheme</b>: 40 (Final term)+30 (midterm)+ 30 (assignments, quizes, recitation); solutions from bonus problems and recitations (voluntary talks on related but special topics) can be used to improve the net midterm+assignment score.<br>
Here is the conversion chart from marks to letter grades. More about the grading scheme can be found by following this <a href="https://www.math.tifrbng.res.in/academic/int-phd-programme/grading-scheme">link</a>.

We will mostly follow standard references in ordinary differential equations. I would recommend the students to follow my notes. Otherwise they can look at <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in/jiten/Extra/Coddrington.pdf">Link 1</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4613-0003-8">Link 2</a>, <a href="https://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/file.php/PHYS289/%CE%92%CE%B9%CE%B2%CE%BB%CE%AF%CE%B1/Arnold%2C%20V.I.%20-%20Ordinary%20differential%20equations_Red.pdf">Link 3</a> <br>

The midterm will be held by 4th October <br>

<p>Please feel free to discuss with your fellow students but the solution must be understood and written on your own. Please do not search for the solutions on the internet. It helps no one (including you). The assignment needs to submitted by email to my Tifr address before the class (scan/tex either will do) or submitted to me in class. You might be asked to explain your solution in class after the quiz failing which your grade for that assignment will be annulled. Further students are encouraged to attempt bonus questions. They might be used later.</p>
