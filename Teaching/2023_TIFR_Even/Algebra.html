We might take inspiration from the books by Artin <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~hrm/palestine/artin-algebra.pdf">"Algebra"</a> and notes by Lior Silberman <a href="https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~lior/teaching/0910/501_F09/">"Link"</a> .<br>

The midterm will be held tentatively on 27th February, 2023 during the office hour. There maybe some student lectures (for extra credit) in case they are enthusiastic. <br>

<p>Please feel free to discuss with your fellow students but the solution must be understood and written on your own. Please do not search for the solutions on the internet. It helps no one (including you). The assignment needs to submitted by email to my Tifr address before the class (scan/tex either will do).</p>
