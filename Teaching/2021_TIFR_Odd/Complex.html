<b>Classes</b> will be held from 9:30 AM to 10:55 AM on Wednesdays and Fridays<br>
<b>Recitation, Discussions and Office Hours</b> will be held from 9:30 AM to 10:55 AM on Mondays (Room number 112). If the students have questions, they are encouraged to ask their queries by Friday lunch so that they can be taken up  on Monday.<br>

The <b>syllabus</b> that we will follow can be found by clicking the following <a href="https://www.math.tifrbng.res.in/academic/int-phd-programme/semester3">link</a>. In addition we may (depending on the time available) cover some additional topics.<br>
<b>Grading Scheme</b>: 40 (Final term)+30 (midterm)+ 30 (assignments and recitation); solutions from bonus problems can be used to improve the net midterm+assignment score.<br>
Here is the conversion chart from marks to letter grades. More about the grading scheme can be found by following this <a href="https://www.math.tifrbng.res.in/academic/int-phd-programme/grading-scheme">link</a>.

<hr><p><font size="+2">Assignment</font><br>

<p>Please feel free to discuss with your fellow students but the solution must be understood and written on your own. At any point the student can be asked to explain a given solution during the office hours. Please do not search for the solutions on the internet. It helps no one (including you). The assignment needs to submitted by email to my Tifr address before the class (scan/tex either will do).</p>

<p>The book often uses open sets when it means regions. By cautious!</p>

<hr><p><font size="+2">Some Resources</font><br>

<p> We will perhaps not be able to cover the material necessary to solve all the questions. So be a bit careful before struggling too hard. I will try to mark out the ones we can solve when I get time.

<p> Prof. K. Rama Murthy's problem collection in complex analysis (this is where I learnt my complex analysis from). <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/foakiu8yss48ob2/K%20Rama%20Murthy.pdf?dl=0">Link</a>

<p> Some Problems in complex analysis meant to help students prepare for their comprehensive exams at Princeton university. This is where I picked up Fermat's last theorem from. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/988s6346el8n8wj/princeton%20Complex.pdf?dl=0">Link</a>
