<b>Classes</b> will be held from 9:00 AM to 10:20 AM on Tuesdays and Thursdays starting from 1st of February. The classes will be held over zoom.<br>
<b>Recitations, Discussions and Office Hours</b> will be held from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM on Wednesdays (Room number 112). If the students have questions, they are encouraged to ask their queries by Tuesday so that they can be taken up on Wednesday. If there is enough interest outside TIFR, we will try to make this available online as well.

<b>Grading Scheme</b>: 40 (Final term)+30 (midterm)+ 30 (assignments and recitation); solutions from bonus problems can be used to improve the net midterm+assignment score.<br>
Here is the conversion chart from marks to letter grades. More about the grading scheme can be found by following this <a href="https://www.math.tifrbng.res.in/academic/int-phd-programme/grading-scheme">link</a>.

<hr><p><font size="+2">Assignments</font><br>

<p>Please feel free to discuss with your fellow students but the solution must be understood and written on your own. At any point the student can be asked to explain a given solution during the office hours. Please do not search for the solutions on the internet. It helps no one (including you). The assignment needs to submitted by email to my Tifr address before the class (scan/tex either will do).</p>
